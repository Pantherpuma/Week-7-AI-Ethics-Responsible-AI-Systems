Bonus Task — 1-Page Policy Proposal for Ethical AI in Healthcare

Policy Title: Responsible AI Use in Clinical Decision Support — PLP Academy Guideline (1 page)

Scope: Clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) that use patient data to suggest diagnoses, risk scores, or treatment options.

Principles: Patient safety, informed consent & autonomy, fairness, transparency, accountability.

1. Patient consent protocols

Explicit informed consent required for secondary use of patient data in model training; consent documents must state purpose, retention period, and opt-out mechanism. For life-critical clinical use, consent must be obtained through clinical governance processes and documented in patient record. Use de-identified data for model training whenever possible.

2. Bias mitigation strategies

Mandatory fairness audits before deployment comparing clinically relevant error metrics across protected groups (race, sex, age).

Apply pre-, in-, and post-processing mitigation techniques and choose model thresholds differently by group only if clinically justified and with oversight.

Continuous monitoring in deployment with scheduled re-evaluations (e.g., quarterly) and retraining protocols when population drift is detected.

3. Transparency & explainability requirements

Provide clinicians with concise model summaries (inputs, training data provenance, known limitations) and case-level explanations (feature contributions or counterfactuals) where feasible. Publish an accessible algorithmic impact statement for patients and regulators.

4. Human oversight & clinical governance

CDSS outputs are advisory only; final clinical decisions remain with licensed professionals. Require logs of when model output influenced decisions for audit. Establish multidisciplinary governance boards (clinicians, ethicists, patient representatives) to review incidents and updates.

5. Data security & privacy

Enforce strict access controls, encryption at rest/in transit, and retention limits. Maintain procedures for secure deletion and breach reporting.

6. Redress & accountability

Provide clear complaint and redress pathways for patients citing harm from AI-influenced care. Assign accountable roles (data steward, clinical safety officer) and maintain public audit summaries.
